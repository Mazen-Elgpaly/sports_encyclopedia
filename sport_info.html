            Basketball is a fast-paced team sport where two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender’s hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. It is one of the world’s most popular and widely viewed sports.

            A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

          <p>
            Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, as a way to keep athletes active indoors during the winter months. The original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets as hoops. Over time, the game evolved rapidly — dribbling was introduced, and the modern basketball and hoop design became standardized.

          <p>
            By the early 20th century, basketball spread to colleges and schools across the United States and beyond. Today, it is played professionally in leagues worldwide, with the NBA being the most prominent, showcasing some of the best athletes in the world.

            A standard basketball game is played between two teams of five players on the court at one time. The goal is to score by shooting the ball through the opponent’s hoop while preventing the opposing team from doing the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is divided into periods or quarters, and the team with the most points at the end wins. Players can move the ball by dribbling or passing. Common violations include traveling, double-dribbling, and goaltending. Fouls occur when there’s illegal physical contact, and free throws are awarded depending on the situation.

            Basketball equipment includes the ball, hoop, backboard, court, and player uniforms. The official basketball is an orange ball with black seams, designed for grip and bounce. The hoop consists of a metal rim with a net attached, set at a height of 10 feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players wear lightweight, breathable uniforms — typically a jersey, shorts, and sneakers designed for agility and traction on the court. Professional games also use electronic scoreboards, shot clocks, and video replay systems for accurate officiating.
